# Project Configuration - InsightBox MasterChef Demo

## Branch Strategy Override
**INTENTIONAL RULE BREAK**: Working directly on main branch for demo speed

- **Reason**: Need maximum speed for live demo/presentation
- **Override**: Global rule "Never commit changes straight to main" is intentionally broken
- **Scope**: This project only - not a general rule change
- **Duration**: For the duration of this demo project

## Project Goals
- Build InsightBox micro-dashboard live during presentation
- Demonstrate Cursor AI + Supabase + ChatGPT integration
- Show real-time development workflow
- Create deployable demo in 20 minutes

## Tech Stack
- Next.js with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Supabase for backend/database
- OpenAI ChatGPT API for insights
- Vercel for deployment

## Development Approach
- Direct commits to main branch for speed
- Live coding during presentation
- Minimal setup time
- Focus on working demo over perfect code structure

## Notes
- This is a demo project, not production code
- Speed and working demo are prioritized over best practices
- Will revert to proper branch strategy after demo
